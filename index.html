            <p>My gaming setup consists of: An old customized computer
                with 32GB of ram, it can play BeamNG at 80fps but not without
                overheating first😭. I have an HP laptop that I use mostly for school,
                It has 16GB of ram but it isn't really for gaming. To play my favorite games
                I have a steering wheel/joystick from PXN and logitech for new years,
                The most expencive thing in my room. I have a first generation iPad that is
                restored and I use it when I am not in my country.
